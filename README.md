# Express basic website

## Introduction

Pick a person that you admire and build a website that shares some basic information about them. They can be a writer, a musician, a celebrity, or someone you know personally.

You should use `express` to create your app, build the routing logic with the built-in app routing methods, and serve static content for every request.

## Requirements

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Solved Lab"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

**Your Website should have (at least) 3 pages:**

1. A **Home** page, that welcomes the visitor and links to the other pages on the website.
2. An **About** page, that shares some basic information about the person.
3. A **Works** page, where you showcase some of the work of the person you chose.
4. Bonus: A **Photo Gallery** page, displaying some pictures of the person/their work.

You should go through the following steps:

1. Run `npm init -y` to create a package.json file.
2. Run `npm install express` to install the Express package.
3. Create a `views/` directory that will hold your `.html` files.
4. Create a `public/` directory that will hold other static files, such as your CSS stylesheets, scripts and images.
5. Build your Express app in `app.js`.
6. Polish your HTML, stylesheets and scripts.

Happy coding! ðŸ’™
